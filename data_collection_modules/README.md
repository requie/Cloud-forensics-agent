# Data Collection Modules for Cloud Forensics AI Agent

This directory contains the implementation of the data collection modules for the Cloud Forensics AI Agent. These modules are responsible for gathering evidence from various cloud environments while maintaining forensic integrity and chain of custody.

## Overview

The data collection modules follow the architecture defined in the agent architecture document and implement the requirements specified in the AI agent requirements document. They are designed to collect evidence from multiple cloud providers and service models while ensuring data integrity and proper documentation.

## Module Structure

The data collection modules are organized as follows:

```
data_collection_modules/
├── core/                  # Core collection functionality
├── providers/             # Cloud provider-specific collectors
│   ├── aws/               # Amazon Web Services collectors
│   ├── azure/             # Microsoft Azure collectors
│   ├── gcp/               # Google Cloud Platform collectors
│   └── private_cloud/     # Private cloud collectors
├── service_models/        # Service model-specific collectors
│   ├── iaas/              # Infrastructure as a Service collectors
│   ├── paas/              # Platform as a Service collectors
│   └── saas/              # Software as a Service collectors
├── utils/                 # Utility functions and helpers
└── README.md              # This file
```

## Implementation Details

Each data collection module will be implemented as a Python package with clear interfaces and documentation. The modules will use cloud provider APIs, SDKs, and other tools to collect evidence while maintaining forensic integrity.
